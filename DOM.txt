NOTES:
DOM --> document object model

* It is the structured representation(tree structure) of the html documents.

* Allows javascript to access html elements and css styles to manipulate them.

* DOM is a connection point between the html documents and javascript code

* DOM is automatically created by browser as soon as html page loads and it   is   stored in a treee structure, where each html element is one object..

* every element in the DOM tree is an object 

* The top(root) of the DOM tree has a object called document 

* The document object acts as entry point to the DOM tree

* Using the document object we can interact every other object
  > ex: document.querySelector('selector');

* first object in DOM tree structure is the html(after document object) object (<html></html>)
